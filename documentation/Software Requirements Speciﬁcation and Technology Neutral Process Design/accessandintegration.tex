\subsection{Access and Integration requirements}
\subsubsection{Access Channels}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Human Access Channels}\newline\newline
	The system will primarily be accessed via a web browser, which should then be able to access the services offered by the 	system through RESTful web services. Furthermore, the system will be written in such a way to easily produce a mobile app, thus allowing users to also access the same system via a mobile application.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Integration Channels}
\begin{itemize}
\item{LDAP}\newline\newline
The system needs to integrate with an existing user database as provided by EpiUse Advance. The system will make use of LDAP in order to achieve this, since the existing database is already set up with this protocol.
\end{itemize}
