When creating a project, the user must explicitly save the project tree. This can be done by clicking on the "Save Project" button, as seen in the bottom left corner of the figure below

	\begin{figure}[H]
	    	\centering
	    	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{saveProject}}
	    	\caption{Save Project}
	    	\label{fig: Save Project}
   	\end{figure}

If the user has not yet saved the project, and prompts to navigate away from editing the project, the user will be prompted with the confirmation dialog displayed in the figure below.

	\begin{figure}[H]
	    	\centering
	    	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{confirmNavigateAway}}
	    	\caption{Confirmation of navigation away}
	    	\label{fig: Confirmation}
   	\end{figure}

If the user wishes to discard changes, he/she can prompt to navigate away. Otherwise, the user can cancel the navigation process, and then save the project, and then continue to navigate away.

A similiar process is performed when a user is in the process of Estimation.
