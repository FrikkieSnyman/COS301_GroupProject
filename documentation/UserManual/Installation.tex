The installation is quite a easy process as we are using standard web technologies. We can deploy our system in one of two ways. Either we can use a docker image to load the system or we can set it up by loading all the dependancies to a machine. We are using the mean stack should you encounter any issues please consult their webpage. \url{http://mean.io}
\subsection{Setting up the environment}
To use our application the following prerequisites are required.
\begin{itemize}
	\item NPM(Node Package manager) and node.js 
	For the latest information on installing npm please visit \url{https://nodejs.org/download/} Once you have this setup properly it is important to make usr you have the latest version installed.
	\item GULP or BOWER for client side dependancies.
	Either of these two technologies work with out stack and the can be installed by making use of npm.
	\newline
	npm install -g BOWER or npm install -g GULP 
	\item MongoDB document database. Mongo has very different installation instructions thus it is best to consult the following website \url{https://www.mongodb.org}.
